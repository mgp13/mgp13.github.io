I am a postdoctoral research fellow in [Dr Ilya Korsunsky's lab](https://www.korsunskylab.org/) at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital. My research interests include developing computational methods which exploit multi-omics datasets to learn the mechanisms of inflammatory and autoimmune disease.  

From 2017-2022, I worked on my PhD in Biophysics with [Dr Juilee Thakar](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/thakar.aspx) at the University of Rochester, NY. My graduate work focused on algorithms which use multiomics data to model immune signaling networks in the contexts of health and disease.

I enjoy designing and building open-source software for an audience of both wet & dry lab biologists. I also enjoy mentoring undergraduate students in a laboratory setting, and teaching bioinformatics at the graduate level.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, listening to and playing classical music, reading, art, and exploring the beautiful Massachusetts countryside.
