Starting late February 2023, I will be a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Ilya Korsunsky Lab](https://www.korsunskylab.org/) at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital. My research interests include developing computational methods which exploit multi-omics datasets to learn the mechanisms of inflammatory and autoimmune disease.  

From 2017-2022, I worked on my PhD in Biophysics with [Dr Juilee Thakar](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/thakar.aspx) at the University of Rochester, NY. My graduate work focused on algorithms which use multiomics data to model immune signaling networks in the contexts of health and disease.

I enjoy designing and building open-source software for an audience of both wet & dry lab biologists. I also enjoy mentoring undergraduate students in a laboratory setting, and teaching bioinformatics at the graduate level.

In my spare time, I enjoy trying new recipes, hiking in beautiful New England, playing the piano, and coding on personal software projects.
